# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


4. Check Client-Side API Endpoint

    Make sure the client correctly points to the /api/uploadthing/imageUploader endpoint when making upload requests.

Updated Input Field in Profile Component:

<input
  type="file"
  ref={fileRef}
  hidden
  accept="image/*"
  onChange={(e) => setFile(e.target.files[0])}
/>
<img
  onClick={() => fileRef.current.click()}
  src={formData?.avatar || currentUser.avatar}
  alt="profile"
  className="rounded-full h-24 w-24 object-cover cursor-pointer self-center mt-2"
/>

5. Debugging Tips

    Check the Server Logs: Ensure the onUploadComplete callback in uploadthing.ts logs the correct data after an upload.
    Inspect API Calls: Use browser developer tools to verify requests to /api/uploadthing/imageUploader and their responses.
    Validate File Constraints: Ensure uploaded files meet the maxFileSize and maxFileCount constraints defined in your uploadRouter.

6. Optional Improvements

    Handle Authentication: If user authentication is required for uploads, add middleware to validate the user's session/token before allowing uploads.
    Improve Feedback: Provide clear feedback to the user about the upload status, errors, or success.

Would you like me to adjust any other parts of the integration or focus on specific areas?
